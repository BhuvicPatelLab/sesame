Imports includes 21 non-default packages.
Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any of
them becoming unavailable.  Move as many as possible to Suggests and
use conditionally.

The suggested packages are required for a complete check.
Checking can be attempted without them by setting the environment
variable _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_ to a false value.

See section ‘The DESCRIPTION file’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’
manual.
